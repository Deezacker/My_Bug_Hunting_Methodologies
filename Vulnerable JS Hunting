Manual vs. Automated JS Analysis
A. Manual JavaScript Analysis
Automation is fast, but the human eye catches what machines miss.
When I started, I relied on manual inspection — opening DevTools, scanning JS files line by line. Here’s what worked:
Key Tools:

    Browser DevTools (Chrome/Firefox) — Press F12 and check the Sources tab.
    Burp Suite — Intercept JS files in transit.
    Regex Search — Hunt for keywords like:

api_key
aws_secret
password
token
Pro Tip:
Use regex patterns to find hidden secrets. Example:

grep -E "api[_-]?key|token|secret|password" file.js

Why manual checks matter:

    You’ll spot hardcoded credentials that regex might miss.
    You’ll understand application logic (e.g., how auth tokens are handled).

B. Automated Recon
Machines do the grunt work — so you can focus on exploitation.
Once I had a baseline understanding, I automated the process. Here’s my favorite toolchain:
Step 1: Extract JavaScript Files
Using GAU (Get All URLs) and Waybackurls:

cat targets.txt | gau | grep ".js$" | httpx -mc 200 > js_files.txt

This fetches all live JS files from a target domain.
Step 2: Scan for Secrets
I used Nuclei and JSFScan.sh (by KathanP19):

cat js_files.txt | nuclei -t secrets -o js_secrets.txt

Why automation wins:

    Processes thousands of files in minutes.
    Catches low-hanging fruit (API keys, tokens).

How I Found 127 Bugs
Step 1: Gathering JavaScript Files
I ran subjs on 50+ domains:

subjs -l domains.txt -o all_js_files.txt

Result: Over 2,000+ JS files collected.
Step 2: Running Automated Scans
I used Mantra, a JS analysis tool:

cat all_js_files.txt | mantra -o vulnerabilities.json

Findings:

    19 exposed API keys (AWS, Stripe, Firebase).
    43 debug endpoints left open.

Step 3: Manual Deep Dive
Automation flagged potential issues, but manual review confirmed them.
What I found:

    Hardcoded admin credentials in a React.js file.
    JWT tokens are stored in localStorage without encryption.
    Database connection strings in a minified Angular script.

Total vulnerabilities confirmed: 127 (mix of high, medium, and low risk).
Pro Tips for Bug Hunters
1. Use a “Secret Finder” Script
I wrote a Python script to detect JWTs, OAuth tokens, and AWS keys:

import re  
with open("file.js", "r") as f:  
    if re.search("(eyJ[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{10,}\.eyJ[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{10,}\.[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{10,})", f.read()):  
        print("JWT Token Found!")

2. Avoid False Positives
Not every “api_key” is real. Verify with:

httpx -l keys.txt -status-code -title
